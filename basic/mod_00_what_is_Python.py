MOD 00: What is Python?
'''


#===============================================================================
# EXERCISE: Execute the following command:
#     $ python -c "import this"
#===============================================================================

# From official website ( http://www.python.org/ ):
#
#     Python is a programming language that lets you work more quickly and integrate
#     your systems more effectively. You can learn to use Python and see almost
#     immediate gains in productivity and lower maintenance costs.

# Executive summary from official website ( http://www.python.org/doc/essays/blurb.html )
#
#     Python is an interpreted, object-oriented, high-level programming language
#     with dynamic semantics. Its high-level built in data structures, combined
#     with dynamic typing and dynamic binding, make it very attractive for Rapid
#     Application Development, as well as for use as a scripting or glue language
#     to connect existing components together. Python's simple, easy to learn syntax
#     emphasizes readability and therefore reduces the cost of program maintenance.
#     Python supports modules and packages, which encourages program modularity and
#     code reuse. The Python interpreter and the extensive standard library are
#     available in source or binary form without charge for all major platforms,
#     and can be freely distributed.

# From Wikipedia ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Python_(programming_language) ):
#
#     Python is a general-purpose, high-level programming language whose design
#     philosophy emphasizes code readability. Python's syntax allows programmers
#     to express concepts in fewer lines of code than would be possible in languages
#     such as C, and the language provides constructs intended to enable clear
#     programs on both a small and large scale.
#
#     Python supports multiple programming paradigms, including object-oriented,
#     imperative and functional programming styles. It features a fully dynamic
#     type system and automatic memory management and has a large and comprehensive
#     standard library.

# TO SUM UP
#  - quick development
#  - simple, readable, easy to learn syntax
#  - general purpose
#  - interpreted (not compiled)
#  - object-oriented
#  - high-level
#  - dynamic semantics (aka execution semantics)
#  - fully dynamic typing
#  - dynamic binding
#  - low programs manteinance cost
#  - modularity and code reuse
#  - no licensing costs
#  - extensive standard library, "batteries included"
#  - imperative and functional programming
#  - automatic memory management

# BONUS: Python is named after TV series Monty Python's Flying Circus, and it is common
# to use Monty Python references in example code. For instance, it is typical to use
# 'spam' and 'eggs', instead of the traditional 'foo' and 'bar'.
